# Code from the lecture

Analyze the code. Please look at the following things:
 * Dual use of **this**
 * placement of **this()** on the first line of the constructor
 * Use of static variables
 * Analyze the impact of returning the reference variable, and the possibility of breaking of the encapsulation by modifying the object that it points to
